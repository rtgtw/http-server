    <h1>This is an HTML document that is being served from a Custom HTTP Server</h1>
    <p>HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is a Layer 7 Application Protocol.
    All this means is, a client and server can communicate by saying "GET" or "POST"
    and there are functions inside of both the Server code and the client code
    (Usually from a user agent like a Web Browser that handles this for you) which
    both adhere to this protocol. You can literally make Something called Banana Protocol
    or BP and if a client and server adheres to it, then boom, its a Layer 7 protocol</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h1>HTTP is just TCP at its core</h1>
    <p>TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is a layer 4 Protocol, that is the
    backbone of the internet as we know it. A TCP socket is used, which is implemetned
    within a network stack of an operating system. The process of two hosts communicating
    is handled by this network stack, so that code is probably pretty advanced.
    Anyways, a TCP socket allows two hosts to communicate with functions provided
    by the operating system like bind(), recv(), accept(), conn(), etc...
    this HTTP Server was implemented in Python, but it could also be implemented
    in any programming language that has a <b>standard library</b> that takes the
    OS kernel API system calls and converts it into a library for people to code in,
    its really that simple. If a programming language did not come with standard libraries
    then that means I would somehow have to know how to use assembly or somehow
    use the windows API to make the system calls myself.
    <br><br>
    TCP is very very important and powerful and its super cool to think at its core
    its just really smart people making it easier for two machines to communicate</p>
